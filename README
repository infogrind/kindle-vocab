How to copy the DB file from the Kindle:

cp /Volumes/Kindle/system/vocabulary/vocab.db .

(If the Kindle doesn't show up on OS X as a USB volume when plugged in, restart
it while keeping it plugged in. To do this, press the button for 7 seconds and
select "Restart" in the menu that appears.)

How to export the words from the .db file into a plain text file:

echo ".mode csv
 select word from WORDS;" | sqlite3 vocab.db > words.txt

Alternatively: use the export_words script, which does exactly that, and save
its output to a file.
